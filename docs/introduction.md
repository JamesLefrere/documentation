Orion is an open source framework built on meteor that makes complex as well as simple apps possible with minimal effort. Itâ€™s built, modified, used, and supported by an active community of people around the world.

## Getting Started

To start to you orion the first thing you need to do is install the core package and a admin template.
Orion has 2 templates, one for [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and one for [materialize](http://materializecss.com).

```sh
meteor add orionjs:core

```sh
meteor add twbs:boostrap

meteor add orionjs:materialize
