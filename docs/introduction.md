# Orion

Orion is an open source framework built on meteor that makes complex as well as simple apps possible with minimal effort. Itâ€™s built, modified, used, and supported by an active community of people around the world.

## Getting Started

To start your orion instance the first thing you need to do is install the core package and an admin template.
Orion has 2 templates, one for [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and one for [materialize](http://materializecss.com) - more are coming.

```sh
meteor add orionjs:core
```

And now decide which one to use

```sh
meteor add twbs:bootstrap
meteor add orionjs:bootstrap
```

or

```sh
materialize:materialize
meteor add orionjs:materialize
```
