# Accounts

Orion allows for you to create accounts with different roles so that users can login and manage app content and configuration.

## Creating accounts

Orion has 3 ways to create accounts:

- **Admin account**. By default account creation is closed, but when there is no
admin (no user that has the admin role), Orion will allow you to create an account
that will be automatically granted an ```admin``` role.

- **Invitations**. The admin can invite users, you must navigate to the 
accounts tab and press +. This will generate a invitation link which you need to
pass to the new user. If you set an email address on the invitation, the new user must have access to that email address.

- **Open Registration**. With Open Registration, you can allow anyone to publicly register.

### Public registration
##### Enabling Public Registration
To allow anyone to register an account for your app, make sure to set the ```'forbidClientAccountCreation'``` option to ```false```.

```js
Options.set('forbidClientAccountCreation', false);
```

##### Default Roles

New users will not have any roles by default, unless you specify default roles:

```
Options.set('defaultRoles', ['role1', 'role2']);
```
